            <p>
                Hi there.  My name is Arron Pelc.  I graduated from Metropolitan Community College in May, 2020, with an Associate's 
                degree in computer science, specializing in software development.  I currently work in the legal field for the Missouri
                State Public Defender's office in capital litigation (which is legalese for death penalty trials).  It's an interesting 
                job and I've learned a lot about both the justice system and myself.  
            </p>  
            <p>
                In my spare time I like to learn new coding techniques, cook, paint, check out art galleries, ride my bike, and puruse
                River Market and downtown with friends.  I also enjoy video editing and taking pictures. Looking toward the future, I will be starting at the University of Central 
                Missouri in the fall of 2020 to begin working toward a bachelor's degree in software development and engineering.  When 
                it's all said and done, I'd like to finish with a master's degree and teach on the side.  
            </p>
