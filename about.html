            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello.  My name is Arron.  I graduated from MCC-KC's Computer Science program with an associate degree                
                in software development in May, 2020, and will attend the University of Central Missouri beginning fall 
                of 2020 to earn a bachelor's degree.  From an early age I fell in love with computers and technology, 
                plucking around on an old Commodore64 my parents had laying around.  I remember being enamored by the
                enormous 5 1/2" floppy disks and the disk-drive that sounded like a pencil grinder with metal caught in 
                the gears.  Ah the good ol' days.
            </p>
            <p>
                We've come a long way since then.  My wristwatch can do things the Commodore64 could have never dreamed,
                and everywhere you look software is marching into our daily lives with no sign of retreat.  It's
                a new frontier, and one in which I want to be part. 
               
            </p>
