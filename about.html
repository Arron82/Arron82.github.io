            <p class="description">
                I graduated in May, 2020, with an Associate's degree in Computer Science, emphasis in software development,
                from Metropolitan Community College - Kansas City.
                <br><br>
                I'm currently enrolled in the University of Central Missouri's Computer Science program for software development,
                and plan to graduate in the spring of 2022 with a Bachelor's degree.  
                <br><br>
                Ideally I would love to begin my career in technology with a company that I can stay with for the long haul 
                and grow professionally as I continue my education.
