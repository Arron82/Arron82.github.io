            <h3>Battleship</h3>
            <p>
                 This program is a single-player, turn based battleship game where the user 
                 must destroy all enemy ships before running out of missiles.  There is an option 
                 to view the opposing board, if you're into that sort of (*ahem* cheating *ahem*) 
                 thing.  
            </p>
            <p>
                 The technique used here was two 2-dimensional arrays, one holding the positions of
                 'enemy ships' and the other referencing it for strike and miss visual on the displayed
                 grid.  
            </p>

            <h3>Bowling Score</h3>
            <p>
                 This simple program tallies scores for a bowling game.  scores
                 are entered and points are displayed on screen.  The scores for each frame
                 are automatically generated in this program.
            <p>
                 The real highlight here was figuring out how to score bowling in the first place. ;)
